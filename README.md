# KotLT
[K]all of the Long Turkey, a rebuild of Ostrasized using Unreal C++

Developed after an attempt to master UE4's blueprint system (which I didn't -- see [Ostrasized](https://github.com/stained/ostrasized) for that attempt). 

Feel free to scavange [placeholder] content and/or code if you find it useful.
